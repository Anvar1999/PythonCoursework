# Assignment 1
color = input('Enter your favorite color: ')

# Assignment 2
# a, b, c, d
b = a + 2
a = b * 4
b = a / 3.14
a = b - 8

# Assignment 3
due = total â€“ down_payment 

# Assignment 4
print(format(number, ',.1f'))

# Assignment 5	
# Variables to hold the distances.
distance6Hours = 0.0
distance10Hours = 0.0
distance15Hours = 0.0

# Constant for the speed.
SPEED = 70

# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.
distance6Hours = SPEED * 6
distance10Hours = SPEED * 10
distance15Hours = SPEED * 15 

# Print the results.
print ("The car will travel the following distances:")
print (distance6Hours,"miles in 6 hours.")
print (distance10Hours,"miles in 10 hours.")
print (distance15Hours,"miles in 15 hours.")


# Assignment 6	
# Declare variables to hold miles driven, gallons
# of fuel used, and miles-per-gallon.
miles = 0.0
gallons = 0.0
mpg = 0.0

# Get the miles driven.
miles = float(input("Enter the miles driven: "))

# Get the gallons of fuel used.
gallons = float(input("Enter the gallons of fuel used: "))

# Calculate miles-per-gallon.
mpg = miles / gallons

# Print the result.
print ("You used", format(mpg, '.2f'), "miles per gallon.")
